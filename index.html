        <p>Hola, Internet friends. I am just hanging out here in Colorado <span id="player"></span> and being a training director for <a href="https://ire.org" target-"_blank">Investigative Reporters and Editors</a>. (Yes it <i>is</i> great, thank you for asking.)</p>

        <p>Before that, I was a developer for the Austin American-Statesman and before that I was a reporter at the Omaha World-Herald and before <i>that</i> I was a reporter at the Sioux Falls Argus Leader.</p>

        <!--<p>If you came here to see some of my recent projects, <a href="/projects">you can do that here</a>.</p>-->

        <p>If you're wondering what books I've been reading lately, <a href="/read">that's this guy over here</a>.</p>

        <p>If you need a data file of all the times the phrase "meatball surgery" was spoken during an episode of the hit TV show M*A*S*H, <a href="/data/meatball-surgery.json">I got your JSON right here</a>.</p>

        <p>If I'm dead and you're looking for my will, <a href="/last-will-and-testament/">click here</a>.</p>

        <p>If I'm still alive, feel free to <a href="mailto:cjwinchester@gmail.com">send me an email</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/cody_winchester" target="_blank">follow me on Twitter</a> or poke through <a href="https://github.com/cjwinchester" target="_blank">my code on Github</a>.</p>
