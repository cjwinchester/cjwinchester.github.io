            <hr>
            <p class="lead">Being eighteen years of age or older and of sound mind, I, Cody John Winchester of Omaha, Nebraska, declare this to be my last will and testament.</p>
            <p class="lead">My remains are to be cremated in a burial shroud &mdash; no embalming, no coffin, no funeral, no urn. (A memorial service or wake is fine; the idea is to avoid dealing with a funeral director. Check state law and the <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0300-ftc-funeral-rule">FTC funeral rule</a>: Crematoria must give you a price list of basic services, you're not required to buy a coffin or embalm a corpse, etc.) Donations to <a href="http://ire.org/">Investigative Reporters and Editors</a> in lieu of flowers. Ashes scattered from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/43%C2%B018'36.5%22N+109%C2%B005'41.4%22W/@43.310149,-109.094819,538m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0">Crowheart Butte</a>. <a href="https://omaha-dot-com.bloxcms-ny1.com/site/forms/announcements/obituary/">Obituary in the Omaha World-Herald</a>.
            <p class="lead">If my manner of death is such that it draws media attention, Samuel Harbert of Spearfish, South Dakota, is authorized to act as family spokesman. In all media appearances, Mr. Harbert must wear a T-shirt featuring the insignia of a death metal band and use the word "crapulence" at least once.</p>
            <p class="lead">All money and personal property to my wife, Laurel, and children, Julian and Lucy, except for the following items:</p>
            <ul class="lead">
                <li>My guitar and the DVD "Animal Crackers" and my hookah to Mr. Harbert.</li>
                <li>My desktop computer and the book "An Intellectual History of Cannibalism" and my blue tank top to Grant Halseide of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.</li>
                <li>Any books by George Saunders and my 1997 Bible-quizzing trophy to my sister Amanda.</li>
                <li>The book "Riddley Walker" and the rights to the domain codywinchester.com to Matt Wynn of Omaha.</li>
                <li>My case of CDs to John Hult of Sioux Falls, South Dakota.</li>
                <li>Any books by Salman Rushdie to Chad Shanks of Houston, Texas.</li>
                <li>Any books by Thomas Pynchon to Sean Beherec of Brooklyn, New York.</li>
                <li>My wisdom teeth and my black Chucks and any books by David Foster Wallace to Drue Aman of Denver, Colorado.</li>
                <li>All of my white T-shirts to Justin Mitchell of Portland, Oregon.</li>
                <li>My collection of M*A*S*H DVDs to Roseann Moring, Emily Nohr and Jordan Pascale, on the condition that they gather once a year to watch them all in sequence.</li>
                </ul>
