        "<p>I kind of liked Jules Verne's <i>The Mysterious Island</i>, so I was happy to check out Verne's more famous novel about three explorers &mdash; a man, his <i>insane</i> uncle and the strong, silent Icelander Hans &mdash; whose adventures lead them down <i>into the utmost bowels of the Earth</i>.</p><p>(Spoiler: They don't immediately die in a fire, as you might expect.)</p><p>We read the Great Illustrated Classics version, which was adapted for young readers by Howard Schwach. He kept a lot of what's good about Verne's story &mdash; action! suspense! ancient runes! &mdash; though to my taste his manuscript could've used a few more rounds of copyediting.</p><p>And I'm not saying the story is <i>completely unbelievable</i>, aside from the crazy hollow earth filled with giant cavemen and mushroom forests and mega-dinosaurs, but the part where our heroes surf a wooden raft up a river of boiling lava and out an erupting volcano to safety was a little much,but amazing.<p>"
