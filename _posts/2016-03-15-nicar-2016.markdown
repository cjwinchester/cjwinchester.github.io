Last week I flew to Denver for the annual NICAR conference. Was it a blast? Yes. Yes, it was. I came away with some immediate project ideas &mdash; I want to really dig into unit testing, node.js and makefiles &mdash; and some longer-term goals to grow as a developer.

(Chrys Wu has the big list of slides, links and tutorials [here](http://blog.chryswu.com/2016/03/08/nicar16-slides-links-tutorials-resources/)).

Some highlights:

* For [this project](https://github.com/datadesk/django-for-data-analysis-nicar-2016), the L.A. Times wrote a [model method](https://github.com/datadesk/django-for-data-analysis-nicar-2016/blob/master/building_and_safety/models.py#L128-L150) to generate geojson on the fly and render as json in the views. Def gonna borrow this.
* Talked to a dude with a clever approach to solving captchas on a scraping project: When the script hits the page with a captcha, it pauses, posts a picture of the captcha to a Slack channel, waits for him to solve it, then resumes scraping. Bang bang.

* [This curry shop](http://www.littlecurryshop.com) was _off the dang chain_.
* Christopher Groskopf dropped [a new tool](https://github.com/wireservice/lookup) to simplify common lookups. It's gonna be siiiiiick.
* In one of my favorite sessions, Geoff Hing walked us through debugging and writing tests for Python scripts. Unit tests had never really clicked with me, but he made it super understandable.
* Got to catch up with peeps from the Argus Leader and the Omaha World-Herald ... so I've got that going for me, which is nice.
* Really enjoyed Jon Keegan's presentation on manipulating images with command-line tools. I've played around with some of the software he mentioned, but he's [taking](http://graphics.wsj.com/saturn/) things to [another level](http://graphics.wsj.com/avengers/).
