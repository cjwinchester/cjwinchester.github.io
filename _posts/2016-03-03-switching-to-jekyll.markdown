News! We've moved to Texas so I could take a job on the apps team at the Austin American-Statesman. It's been a hoot and a half, as the kids say.

_Also_, in keeping with my practice of adopting technologies several years after they've been introduced, I switched over my website to [Jekyll][jekyll-link]. (Ha yes I know I'm a Python guy as much as everyone else but [Hyde][hyde-link] was butt and [Jade][jade-link] makes my head hurt and [Hugo][hugo-link] is written in Go, which I guess is fine but I didn't see the big diff? Anyway. Ditching the ol' Tumblr from here out, too.)
